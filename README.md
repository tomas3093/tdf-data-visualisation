# Tour de France statistics
## Interactive data visualisation

## How to run it
* Install node.js and npm
* In root directory run command "npm install" to install all project dependencies
* After that run command "npm run start" to start the application
* Open "localhost:3000" in your favourite browser (but it was tested only on Firefox, so I'm sorry for any inconvenience in other browsers)
* Enjoy ;)
